\section{Graph Embedding}

As we described in the previous section, the reinforcement learning agent must learn to choose two actions at each step in an epoch; the transformation and location from the set available dependent on the current computation graph. In order to learn the optimal action selection, we must create an embedding from the computation graph representation in the machine learning framework to our internal, manipulable graph representation inside our environment, our modified TASO backend.

[TODO] cite related work that used GNN for systems work?

[TODO] explain how we go from ONNX graph $\rightarrow$ TASO representation that can be modified $\rightarrow$ graph\textunderscore nets GNN

- Processing graph network, message passing, latent space
- Auto-encoders
