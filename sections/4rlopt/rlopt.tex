\chapter{XFlowRL: Reinforcement Learning Optimisation}
\label{chap:rlopt}

In this chapter we will introduce the graph optimisation problem and describe the technical details of the design of the two reinforcement learning agents and their components. Furthermore, we will frame the optimisation problem in the RL domain by describing the system environment, the reward calculation and the state-action space. Additionally, we describe the RL agents trained in the model-free and model-based domains as well as highlighting limitations in the application of reinforcement learning to this problem. Finally, we discuss the relative benefits of each approach and the significant challenges that we must overcome to apply RL to this problem and establish the baselines to compare the model-free and model-based agents.
