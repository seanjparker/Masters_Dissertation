\chapter{Reinforcement Learning Agent Design}
In this chapter we describe the technical details of the design of the two reinforcement learning agents and their components in relation to prior work. Further, we also discuss the relative benefits of each approach as well as the significant challenges that we must overcome to apply RL to this problem and establish the baselines to compare the model-free and model-based agents.
