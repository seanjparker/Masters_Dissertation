Dissertation structure.

- Chapter 2 provides a background for computation graphs and their representation of deep learning models, reinforcement learning - both model-free and model-based - in the context of computer systems. Chapter 3 describes the concrete problem we are trying to solve, describe baselines produced by prior works, and formulate the problem in the context of reinforcement learning. Chapter 4 describes our approach to applying reinforcement learning for learning to choose substitutions to optimise the computation graphs as well as learning an accurate model of the environment. Chapter 5 covers the evaluation setup, our experiments and results for different approaches and ways to optimise the approaches. Finally, in chapter 6 we conclude the dissertation with a summary of our findings and discuss potential future work.
